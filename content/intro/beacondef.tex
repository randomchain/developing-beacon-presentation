    \begin{itemize}
        \item Unpredictable 
        \item Unbiased
        \item Entropy Guarantee
        \item Available
        \item Verifiable
    \end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A set of properties to define a trustless randomness beacon - can be partially fulfilled.
            \item Unpredictable: No party should be able to predict the party wit higher probability than any other party.
            \item Unbiased: All outputs are equally likely. 
            \item Ent Gu: There must be a guarantee on the level of output entropy.
            \item Available: All users in a given setting should access to the beacon. 
            \item Verifiable: Users should not need to trust any output. The beacon instead proves its honesty.  
        \end{itemize}}
