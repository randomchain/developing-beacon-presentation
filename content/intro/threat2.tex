\begin{frame}{Threat Review:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Input Biasing \drea{3, 3, 2, 3, 11}
    \item Transparent Operation
    \item Delay Functions
\end{itemize}

    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The more insidious cousin of the last attack - forges a biased, but legit output by pre-imaging possible outputs. An equivalent attack can also be executed by the operator.
            \item Requirement: specifically "unpredictable, even to the beacon operator".
            \item Delay functions - pre-imaging takes a long time, any outside input in the meanwhile wastes your effort.
        \end{itemize}}
