    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The more insidious cousin of the last attack - forges a biased, but legit output by pre-imaging possible outputs. An equivalent attack can also be executed by the operator.
            \item Requirement: specifically "unpredictable, even to the beacon operator".
            \item Hashing functions - they have diffusion and confusion properties - any input unpredictably changes the output. Output space can still be explored.
            \item Delay functions - pre-imaging takes a long time, any outside input in the meanwhile wastes your effort.
        \end{itemize}}
