\begin{frame}{Rational Trust}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Our design allows users to estimate when they should trust the beacon.
        \item \begin{equation*}
            t_\text{COMMITMENT} - t_\text{INPUT}\enspace <\enspace T_\text{DELAY FUNCTION}
        \end{equation*}

    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Design allows us to reason on trust.
            \item Relationship between the time from last input to commit seen and fastest delay function.
            \item Trust despite everyone being against you, as per our initial goal.
        \end{itemize}}
