    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Based on a security analysis, we designed and implemented a beacon with the following features:
            \item Parallel delay functions to minimize the possibility of cheating.
            \item No private information
            \item Practical design with multiple channels for distribution and scaling. Easy to deploy.
        \end{itemize}}
