    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Beacon related is very theoretical, and lacks working proof-of-concept implementations.
            \item Beacons are motivated by crypto usecases, but how secure are they?
            \item Goal is a beacon you can use even if the rest world is colluding against you.
