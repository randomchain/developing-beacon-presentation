\begin{frame}{Threat Review:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the threat?
    \item What requirements did it lead to?
    \item How did the design mitigate it?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
    \note{
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Our design was based on the threats we found towards beacons.
            \item Show how a single threat was handled - essentially working from problem to solution.
            \item All threats are based on a theoretical transparent authority beacon.
        \end{itemize}}
